1/ In my project, if you create a new shop, then I have made functionality that allows you to go to your Dashboard.

2/ If you can create and add maximum 3 products in the first stage and use mongodb for storing your product data in database.

3/ We have created a functionality feature where you can edit and remove the products you have created.

4/ You can search your product by id and checkout. I have made the functionality to calculate the total amount of money you have profited and invested.

5/ I have created a dashboard sale summary for you where you can get all the information about the total income and the total amount sold.
